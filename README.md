# energy_sex_reversal
Energetic consequences of sex reversal in two different genetic sex determining systems. To better understand the consequences of sex-reversal, we measured three traits related to fitness (metabolism, growth rate, and survival) in hatchling lizards of two species with different patterns of temperature-induced sex-reversal, Bassiana duperreyi and Pogona vitticeps. For B. duperreyi sex-reversal occurs when chromosomally female (XXf) individuals are masculinised to male phenotypes (XXm) at low egg incubation temperatures, and for P. vitticeps sex-reversal occurs when chromosomally male (ZZm) individuals are feminised to phenotypic females (ZZf) at high incubation temperatures. We show that metabolism and growth-rate for sex-reversed individuals are more reflective of their reproductive phenotype rather their chromosome complement. 

# Analysis - metadata
The file "sexreversal.analysis.R" has all the code for the BRMS models for each species and the trait being measured (metabolism, growth), with their appropriate checks. Also there you'll find analysis for survivorship. Headings will provide detail of code that follows. Information has been saved for each final analysis which was then used in the .rmd file.


# Rmd file
rmd file has both methods, results, and tables as appeared in the text. Code chunks detail analysis that is being conducted for each section.
